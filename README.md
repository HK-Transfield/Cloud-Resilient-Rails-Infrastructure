# AWS Hosted Ruby-On-Rails Web Application ‚ô¶

The goal of this project is to help with familiarising
yourself with deploying an entire infrastructure in
AWS using Terraform.

The infrastructure is comprised  of a app server and database spun up with cloud resiliency features
(i.e. Load balancers, Autoscaling) using Terraform. Using this project assumes you have general
knowledge of AWS security best practices, like private subnets etc.

When deployed, it should display a webpage accessible through any web browser. This uses Ruby-on-Rails
as the server-side web application framework. It would have a domain that would show it alternating
between two Availability Zones via the Application Load Balancer.

## Architecture Overview üèóÔ∏è
